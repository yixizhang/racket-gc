===
add modulo, etc., to mutator
try depth-first for copying traverse/ref
support of vector/struct/struct-instance for gc->scheme/member?/equal?, etc.
maybe double vector size when all slots are filled (check paper/algo/wiki)
===
update mutator so it supports *values*
add make-vector/vector-ref/vector-set!, etc., in mutator
stored in vector slot should be ptr to pair
each hash-key corresponds to a list of values
gc:vector should alloc a vector and set each slot to given loc
(and (procedure? fail) (procedure-arity-includes? fail 0))
make-pointers-to-2nd-gen-root should check the case that to-space in young generation is exactly full
change if to cond in gc:vector-set!
